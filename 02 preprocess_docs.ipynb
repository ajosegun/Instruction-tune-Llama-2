      "In the scope of IFFO and YCF, new innovations can be captured as engines. An engine is a specific ingredient or a combination of ingredients specifically processed to obtain a clinically proven health benefit of the product in which it is contained. This document describes the engine of the pHP hydrolysate for allergy prevention (referred to as pHP in the rest of the document) and how changes in the hydrolysate recipe and process should be evaluated to make sure that the engine remains secured. The intended audience for this document is supply points that produce pHP hydrolysates and/or products containing these recipes, and R&I (including local PD teams). The pHP hydrolysate recipe codes are 217070 (non-halal) 217071 (MIDAS), 217072 (Wheytrix), 217075 (MIDAS with powder enzymes) and 217777 (China) and will be referred to as 21XXXX in this document. Recipe 217072 (Wheytrix, master recipe, version 1) has been used in the pHP Regulatory Dossier that was submitted to EFSA in 2020. \n",

      "Benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "pHP consists of partially hydrolyzed whey protein. In pHP, the whey protein is hydrolyzed enzymatically (broken down) into peptides with the goal to reduce the molecular weight, peptide size and as such, the sensitizing capacity of the proteins. Since partial hydrolysates may contain some large fragments of protein, they may still induce allergic symptoms in cow’s milk allergic (CMA) children, therefore, they are suitable for infants at risk of developing allergies, but not for those with diagnosed CMA. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Safety of the pHP product has been demonstrated by preclinical (in vitro, in vivo) as well as clinical data (growth, tolerance, and formula intake and blood safety parameters). From the in vitro and in vivo studies, it can be concluded that the formula of interest contains <1% of immunoreactive proteins (≈0.1716%) and does not induce sensitization to the intact protein from which the hydrolysate is prepared. \n",
      "\n",
      "Engine\n",
      "\n",
      "The engine of pHP linked to the benefits described above is the partially hydrolyzed whey protein hydrolysate produced inhouse and tested in several in vitro and in vivo studies. The 21XXXX recipes, the raw materials included in these recipes and the processing of these 21XXXX recipes are considered specific for the engine and therefore, need to remain unaltered to secure engine composition and efficacy. The engine is included in the base powder and finally in the end product according to the schema depicted in Figure 1.\n",

      "Figure 1: An illustration of how the pHP engine is incorporated in the base powder and final product\n",
      "\n",
      "Key features of the 21XXXX recipe that should remain unaltered are the ratios between: enzyme activity/protein, protein/ OH-, enzyme/enzyme. If changes are required due to e.g. raw material supply / dual sourcing, factory changes, addition of process aids such as emulsifiers etc., the engine needs to be evaluated based on experimental data obtained from a specific experimental plan as described in the following sections. The evaluation is done by the HEET (described below) who can advise on the experimental protocol and assess the compliance of the engine  with respect to the engine specs. The execution of the experiments shall be carried out by any accountable group in R&I (e.g., PD PSQC in case of protein dual sourcing, Factory Tech or PAT team in case of process adjustment etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In Bestmix currently the recipes with pHP from 0-6 months are indicated with HA (hypo allergenicity) and the ones from 6-12 months with hydrolyzed protein as ingredient. This is due to the fact that currently the communication on hypo allergenicity is only allowed only for 0-6 months. With the new EFSA legislation (2020) also this communication will not be allowed anymore for 0-6 months unless proven by clinical evidence (ongoing Maestro study).\n",

      "Additionally, it needs to be noted that the part of the recipe and process that is not described in this document are not directly linked to securing the engine as long as all raw materials added at this stage are protein free, and cleaning of the line to prevent cross contamination with intact protein is validated and monitored. These requirements are secured by the engine parameters on β-lactoglobulin and casein (method under development) in the product specification powder (PSP) as described below. In addition, also raw materials containing other intact proteins besides cow milk (e.g. sheep, goat, soy etc) should be evaluated by the HEET and QFS before introduction into these products.\n",

      "The key release parameter for production related to the pHP engine is the intact protein content: β-lactoglobulin, which is measured using BLG ELISA and casein, where a ELISA method is in development / validation. In addition, the molecular weight distribution measured using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), is used as monitoring parameter. In general, the experimental approach for engine evaluation will include a combination of trials (lab, pilot, and factory) with specific parameters to evaluate and both the release and monitoring parameters should be within specification for all trials executed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on risk assessment, it can be recommended to undertake the RBL assay, mass spectrometry measurements and/or animal studies to evaluate the complete impact of the change, depending on the proposed change. Results of these trials should always be discussed with the HEET, who will provide the final Go / No Go recommendation for implementation of the change.\n",

      "\n",
      "For all pHP engines, the composition is described in the recipes own by PD, whereas the process steps and the target parameters (heat, time) are captured in the General Technical Specification owned by the COE Process. The main process parameters are described in the process flow chart below. When complied to, these target parameters will ensure that all product engine release and monitoring criteria are within specification. Additionally, the pH curve during hydrolysis is indicative of the quality of the process and therefore should be monitored in the factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The degree of hydrolysis, which can be measured by the Formol Titration Method, is not assessed on a frequent basis (only upon specific request e.g. change in factory). However, since this parameter is often requested by stakeholders outside R&I, they should be incorporated in the PSP once sufficient data sets have been generated.\n",

      "\n",
      "The key features of the 21XXXX recipe that should remain unaltered are e.g. the ratios between: enzyme activity/ protein, protein/ OH-, enzyme/enzyme and the dry matter. In case one of the hydroxides needs to be replaced, the ratio between OH - and protein should be calculated in moles (not in gram). For more information on hydrolysate recipe development please use instruction IN.06.05 in the PD manual. In addition, calculation examples (e.g. OH-/protein ratio) can be found in working document WD.06.05.01 in the PD manual. Please be aware that master recipes or factory-specific recipes can allow to use alternative raw materials e.g. powder vs. liquid whey sources, which might alter the OH-/protein ratio due to a change in the protein content. Therefore, it is important to ensure that ratio calculations are made using the appropriate reference recipe. \n",

      "\n",
      "All raw materials that are present in the hydrolysate recipe (21XXXX) cannot be changed unless the new raw material is evaluated based on an experimental plan, with the results evaluated by the HEET. Table 1 shows the currently approved raw materials for use in pHP hydrolysate manufacture at factory scale. For hydrolysate recipes, raw materials under the same IS code but with a different TS code are not exchangeable without evaluation. In addition, ratios between raw materials in the recipe (e.g. enzymes vs. protein) cannot be modified without the evaluation of the effect on the engine, since these ratios are directly linked to the hydrolysis process.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the scope of IFFO and YCF, new innovations can be captured as engines. An engine is a specific ingredient or a combination of ingredients specifically processed to obtain a clinically proven health benefit of the product in which it is contained. This document describes the engine of the pHP hydrolysate for allergy prevention (referred to as pHP in the rest of the document) and how changes in the hydrolysate recipe and process should be evaluated to make sure that the engine remains secured. The intended audience for this document is supply points that produce pHP hydrolysates and/or products containing these recipes, and R&I (including local PD teams). The pHP hydrolysate recipe codes are 217070 (non-halal) 217071 (MIDAS), 217072 (Wheytrix), 217075 (MIDAS with powder enzymes) and 217777 (China) and will be referred to as 21XXXX in this document. Recipe 217072 (Wheytrix, master recipe, version 1) has been used in the pHP Regulatory Dossier that was submitted to EFSA in 2020. \n",

      "Benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "pHP consists of partially hydrolyzed whey protein. In pHP, the whey protein is hydrolyzed enzymatically (broken down) into peptides with the goal to reduce the molecular weight, peptide size and as such, the sensitizing capacity of the proteins. Since partial hydrolysates may contain some large fragments of protein, they may still induce allergic symptoms in cow’s milk allergic (CMA) children, therefore, they are suitable for infants at risk of developing allergies, but not for those with diagnosed CMA. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Safety of the pHP product has been demonstrated by preclinical (in vitro, in vivo) as well as clinical data (growth, tolerance, and formula intake and blood safety parameters). From the in vitro and in vivo studies, it can be concluded that the formula of interest contains <1% of immunoreactive proteins (≈0.1716%) and does not induce sensitization to the intact protein from which the hydrolysate is prepared. \n",
      "\n",
      "Engine\n",
      "\n",
      "The engine of pHP linked to the benefits described above is the partially hydrolyzed whey protein hydrolysate produced inhouse and tested in several in vitro and in vivo studies. The 21XXXX recipes, the raw materials included in these recipes and the processing of these 21XXXX recipes are considered specific for the engine and therefore, need to remain unaltered to secure engine composition and efficacy. The engine is included in the base powder and finally in the end product according to the schema depicted in Figure 1.\n",

      "\n",
      "Key features of the 21XXXX recipe that should remain unaltered are the ratios between: enzyme activity/protein, protein/ OH-, enzyme/enzyme. If changes are required due to e.g. raw material supply / dual sourcing, factory changes, addition of process aids such as emulsifiers etc., the engine needs to be evaluated based on experimental data obtained from a specific experimental plan as described in the following sections. The evaluation is done by the HEET (described below) who can advise on the experimental protocol and assess the compliance of the engine  with respect to the engine specs. The execution of the experiments shall be carried out by any accountable group in R&I (e.g., PD PSQC in case of protein dual sourcing, Factory Tech or PAT team in case of process adjustment etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In Bestmix currently the recipes with pHP from 0-6 months are indicated with HA (hypo allergenicity) and the ones from 6-12 months with hydrolyzed protein as ingredient. This is due to the fact that currently the communication on hypo allergenicity is only allowed only for 0-6 months. With the new EFSA legislation (2020) also this communication will not be allowed anymore for 0-6 months unless proven by clinical evidence (ongoing Maestro study).\n",

      "Additionally, it needs to be noted that the part of the recipe and process that is not described in this document are not directly linked to securing the engine as long as all raw materials added at this stage are protein free, and cleaning of the line to prevent cross contamination with intact protein is validated and monitored. These requirements are secured by the engine parameters on β-lactoglobulin and casein (method under development) in the product specification powder (PSP) as described below. In addition, also raw materials containing other intact proteins besides cow milk (e.g. sheep, goat, soy etc) should be evaluated by the HEET and QFS before introduction into these products.\n",

When required, the team is temporarily expanded with experts on a specific fields, to enable delivery of the most appropriate recommendation per request. The team is endorsed by the higher management of each discipline and has a clear RACI to support the workflow.\n",

In addition, the molecular weight distribution measured using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), is used as monitoring parameter. In general, the experimental approach for engine evaluation will include a combination of trials (lab, pilot, and factory) with specific parameters to evaluate and both the release and monitoring parameters should be within specification for all trials executed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on risk assessment, it can be recommended to undertake the RBL assay, mass spectrometry measurements and/or animal studies to evaluate the complete impact of the change, depending on the proposed change. Results of these trials should always be discussed with the HEET, who will provide the final Go / No Go recommendation for implementation of the change.\n",

      "For all pHP engines, the composition is described in the recipes own by PD, whereas the process steps and the target parameters (heat, time) are captured in the General Technical Specification owned by the COE Process. The main process parameters are described in the process flow chart below. When complied to, these target parameters will ensure that all product engine release and monitoring criteria are within specification. Additionally, the pH curve during hydrolysis is indicative of the quality of the process and therefore should be monitored in the factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The degree of hydrolysis, which can be measured by the Formol Titration Method, is not assessed on a frequent basis (only upon specific request e.g. change in factory). However, since this parameter is often requested by stakeholders outside R&I, they should be incorporated in the PSP once sufficient data sets have been generated.\n",

      "The key features of the 21XXXX recipe that should remain unaltered are e.g. the ratios between: enzyme activity/ protein, protein/ OH-, enzyme/enzyme and the dry matter. In case one of the hydroxides needs to be replaced, the ratio between OH - and protein should be calculated in moles (not in gram). For more information on hydrolysate recipe development please use instruction IN.06.05 in the PD manual. In addition, calculation examples (e.g. OH-/protein ratio) can be found in working document WD.06.05.01 in the PD manual. Please be aware that master recipes or factory-specific recipes can allow to use alternative raw materials e.g. powder vs. liquid whey sources, which might alter the OH-/protein ratio due to a change in the protein content. Therefore, it is important to ensure that ratio calculations are made using the appropriate reference recipe. \n",

      "\n",
      "All raw materials that are present in the hydrolysate recipe (21XXXX) cannot be changed unless the new raw material is evaluated based on an experimental plan, with the results evaluated by the HEET. Table 1 shows the currently approved raw materials for use in pHP hydrolysate manufacture at factory scale. For hydrolysate recipes, raw materials under the same IS code but with a different TS code are not exchangeable without evaluation. In addition, ratios between raw materials in the recipe (e.g. enzymes vs. protein) cannot be modified without the evaluation of the effect on the engine, since these ratios are directly linked to the hydrolysis process.\n",
